			<h2>COVER LETTER</h2>
			<p>   The story begins with me as a child being fascinated by the new and atypical worlds from Science-Fiction books. Under these circumstances, I began to ask myself what would occur if all these fictive concepts were to be applied in our time. Thus, most of my free time was consecrated to these relaxing escapades through which I was developing a huge passion, a different perspective of life.</p>
 <p> I knew exactly that I wanted to help and inspire people through my work by continuing the early experience I have gained during my years of childhood. As a consequence, I aspired to fulfill my search by learning about the complex programs through which I can share my vision and bring to life the fictional and modern theories that were thought to remain only that. It was fascinating and soon I realized that I will achieve my awaited career in the IT industry. </p>
 <p>As a first step, in 2012 I became student at National High School of Computer Science “Tudor Vianu “, one of the best  colleges in the fields of Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics from Romania. Through Mathematics, my vision became more structured. It came easier to me to notice details, discover ‘traps’ hidden in logical and critical answers and ‘surround’ a problem before solving it. Applying all this to Computer Science, you are less restricted by notions that rely on abstract theorems and you are supposed to free your imagination. Programming is the newest kind of art. However, these subjects are dependent on each other as, in C++ I was supposed to implement formulas and theorems in specific problems. Also, C++ introduces the knowledge basis for C#, making new programming languages less confusing and more enjoyable. In 2016, I graduated high school and obtained my Bacalaureat Diploma with the grade 9,81.</p><p>
Being keen on obtaining exemplary and distinguished IT skills, I enrolled in The Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies – Faculty of Economic Cybernetics, Statistics and Informatics. I am currently in my second year of University and finishing my first semester. Until this moment, from the Economic Informatics sector I studied subjects such as C Programming and Generic Algorithms, Information Technology, Operating Systems, Object Oriented Programming in C++, Basics of Operational Research, Introduction to Assembly Language and SQL Databases. </p><p>
As for foreign languages, I obtained in English the following certificates: IELTS ( Grade 7.5 ) and Cambridge English First ( Grade A ). I hold basic knowledge of German, but in the near future I am planning to take private lessons in order to be able to get a certificate.</p><p>
I believe a large part of the learning process takes place outside the class. So, by volunteering in the “Bucurestii Noi“ Foundation and participating in all the proposed activities I improved both my teamwork ability and coordination skills. Moreover, by supervising children 8 hours a day without following a default schedule, I had to face unexpected situations. Other volunteers from France and Italy offered their assistance, too and as a result of the need of collaboration, we exchanged cultural knowledge. </p><p>
 I am eager to learn more programs from this field, as I enjoy facing new challenges and exploiting new environments. By admiring the people from the industry, being motivated and driven to succeed as them, I aspire to be the best reflection of myself and inspire others. This is how my affinity toward performing in the IT industry took shape. Besides the professional concern, I am a sociable person and I would do everything to make my learning a pleasant experience. This could be the chance to perform my specialization into a suitable environment, having all the needed technical resources.
